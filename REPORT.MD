1. Explain the linking rule in this part's Makefile: $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS). How does it differ from a Makefile rule that links against a library?

The rule $(TARGET): $(OBJECTS) means that the final program (the target) is made from the object files. The compiler takes all the object files and combines them into one executable.

The difference when using a library is that instead of directly combining all the object files, we just tell the compiler to link with the library (for example, -Llib -lmyutils). In that case, the program only pulls in the functions it actually needs from the library.

Q2. What is a git tag and why is it useful in a project? What is the difference between a simple tag and an annotated tag?

A git tag is like a label we put on a specific commit. It is mostly used to mark versions of a project, such as v1.0. Tags are helpful because they make it easy to go back to or download that exact version later.

A simple (lightweight) tag is just a name pointing to a commit, with no extra details. An annotated tag, on the other hand, also stores information like who made the tag, when, and a message about it. Annotated tags are more common when making official releases.

Q3. What is the purpose of creating a "Release" on GitHub? What is the significance of attaching binaries (like your client executable) to it?

A GitHub Release is a way to share an official version of the project with others. It is based on a git tag but also lets you write notes about what changed in that version.

Adding binaries (like the compiled .so library or the executable) is useful because other people donâ€™t need to build the project themselves. They can just download and run the program right away. This also makes sure everyone is using the exact same version you tested.
